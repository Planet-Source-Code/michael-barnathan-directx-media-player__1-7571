### Description

Did you listen to a MIDI file on two different computers and wonder why yours sounded much worse(or better)? This code, using DirectMusic, will play ANY MID file in a way you've never heard it before, in exactly the way the composer wanted it to sound! This program has a media player look, tells you time signature, length of the music, tempo, and even has a slider for the play time! The DirectX initialization code was taken from the Microsoft VB example. All other code is mine. If anyone would like to help me get a better "media player" look, or help me with buffering/seeking through a music file, email webmaster@programmerfaq.com
 
### More Info
 
You need the DirectX 7 SDK to run this code. It is available for free at www.microsoft.com/directx. Have fun downloading it, it's a 122 MB file :)
